    course_detail:
      overview:
        one: In this 2-day Certified Scrum Master course, participants will learn how to stop thrashing and start executing along with everything necessary for getting started with Scrum. There are very few rules to Scrum so it is important to learn its fundamental principles by experiencing them directly from those who have implemented the best Scrums in the software industry. Participants gain hands-on practice with the release backlog, sprint backlog, the daily Scrum meeting, tracking progress with a burn down chart and experience the Scrum process through a “59-minute Scrum” and the "XP Game” which simulate Scrum projects through non-technical group exercises.
        two: This is a two-day course aimed for software development teams, in order to help them gain an in-depth understanding of Agile and Scrum.  This training consists of interactive games and exercises that will challenge students to solve problems that can be faced in real-life situations, when implementing Scrum and Agile into a team. The course includes learning the fundamental thinking of Scrum and Agile, its project management methods and techniques and how to build an efficient Scrum team. Whether they are large teams, outsourcing projects or teams placed in different locations, you will gain a thorough understanding of how to use Scrum and Agile in practice.
